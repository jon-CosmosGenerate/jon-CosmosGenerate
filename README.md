- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jon
- I like impact, technology, and progressive democracy.
- I'm looking to collaborate on projects that change how we interact with technology, each other, and the systems we create (e.g., corporations).
- Interests = AI + data (analytics) + user-centered design + navbars + Microsoft.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning.
- ðŸ“« You can find me in between a skatepark and a large park in NYC. jonathan@cosmosgenerate.com.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I feel both passionate and particular about navbars.
