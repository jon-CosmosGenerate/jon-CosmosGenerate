- 👋 Hi, I’m Jon
- I like impact, technology, and progressive democracy.
- I dressed up as a blue banana for Halloween (frozen banana).
- I'm looking to collaborate on impactful projects that change how we live, how we engage with technology, and how we view communities.
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative AI projects, data analysis, and automation solutions. Whether it's developing cutting-edge algorithms, creating insightful data visualizations, or building robust automation tools, I'm game to push the boundaries of what's been done.
- 📫 How to reach me .. There's a bed of rocks on the Northwest corner of Central Park. One of those rocks is more orange than the others. You'll find my contact information under it.  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: Finance and banking background but then I learned about building stuff.
